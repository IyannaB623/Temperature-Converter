# Temperature-Converter
This project is self expanatory in its title. It was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The converter will convert any numeric value interchangeably between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin. 

:dizzy: You can find notes in the JavaScript on how the converter functions. The converter does not accept non numeric values, and will only return a value with the tenths place to prevent excess remainder values. 

:art: Style is based on a blue pallete. With old video game vibes given the font. 

:cherry_blossom: Happy Converting!
